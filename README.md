# Elevate Chicago (CTA Elevator Alerts) - Published on App Store

This app is developed by Sam Siner. 
It allows users to select their favorite train stations on the Chicago El (CTA) and receive push notifications when an elevator is out-of-order or is back in service. Users can also view all the current elevator alerts, or the elevator alerts for any station.

This app is particularly useful for people with mobility limitations, parents with strollers, people with luggage, or anyone who needs to make sure that a working elevator will be present at a CTA train station.

This app was developed for devices using iOS 13.
